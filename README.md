# Deep_NeuralNetwork_CNN_MATLAB
This repository contains various deep CNN and NN architectures coded in MATLAB. This is also a demonstration of ease of using MATLAB for network design and implementation.

# Why should I choose matlab deep learning toolbox over other opensource frameworks?
A single format data representation using .mat file most compatable and ease in usage.
In many opensource plantfolm like  PyTorch, Tensorflow, Caffe: the way image/data may read or representated using various libraries.
This can create confusion and require many changes in the code.
The avalibility of DeepNetworkDesigner APP. Ease in deployability.

## Most Important:
MATLAB uses resources more efficiently than Python-based deep learning tools. No-one ever says that you 'need' the latest, most expensive NVidia GPU to run MATLAB, in fact only a GPU with a compute power of 3 is suggested, which is pretty old school. Also running into memory errors in Python is common and so annoying, it really compromises the workflow, whereas I've never had such an issue in MATLAB.

## More on...
MATLAB is used by Engineers and Scientists to develop, automate and integrate deep learning models into their domain-specific workflows. It helps them achieve this by providing:
* An open framework that supports interoperability with Python and other open source deep learning frameworks.
* Capabilities that extend beyond modeling to developing end to end applications.
* Integration and Simulation of Deep Learning models into larger domain-specific systems.
* Dedicated support from engineers at MathWorks, developers of MATLAB.
